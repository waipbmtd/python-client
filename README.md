Python client library for [Core API][core-api].

**Requirements**: Python 2.7, 3.3+

---

## Installation

Install from PyPI, using pip:

    $ pip install coreapi-devin

## Quickstart

Create a client instance:

    from coreapi import Client
    client = Client()

Retrieve an API schema:

    document = client.get('https://api.example.org/')

Interact with the API:

    data = client.action(document, ['flights', 'search'], params={
        'from': 'LHR',
        'to': 'PA',
        'date': '2016-10-12'
    })

## Supported formats

The following schema and hypermedia formats are currently supported, either
through built-in support, or as a third-party codec:

Name                | Media type                 | Notes
--------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------
CoreJSON            | `application/coreapi+json` | Supports both Schemas & Hypermedia.
OpenAPI ("Swagger") | `application/openapi+json` | Schema support.
JSON Hyper-Schema   | `application/schema+json`  | Schema support.
HAL                 | `application/hal+json`     | Hypermedia support.

Additionally, the following plain data content types are supported:

Name        | Media type         | Notes
------------|--------------------|---------------------------------
JSON        | `application/json` | Returns Python primitive types.
Plain text  | `text/*`           | Returns a Python string instance.
Other media | `*/*`              | Returns a temporary download file.
